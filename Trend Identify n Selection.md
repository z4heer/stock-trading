## 1. Strong Bullish (Higher Highs/Higher Lows)

### How to Identify Quickly:

  - Rising volume on up moves.
- **Breadth:**  
  - Majority of sector/index stocks in green.

## 3. Sideways / Range-Bound

### How to Identify Quickly:
- **Price Action:**  
  - Price stuck between clear support and resistance for last several candles/days.
  - No new high/lows; wicks on both ends; inside bar patterns.
- **Moving Averages:**  
  - 20 EMA and 50 EMA flat; price crossing above/below frequently.
- **Volume:**  
  - Drops, except near support/resistance.
- **Breadth:**  
  - Mixed, no clear sector leader.
- **Momentum Indicator:**  
  - RSI between 45–55 (neutral).
  - MACD lines close together, flat histogram.

### Favourable Trades:
- Intraday range trade (buy support, sell resistance)
- Option Sell (Strangle/Straddle for premium decay)
- **Stock Futures:** Cautious short-duration trades near edges of range, with tight stops; generally, avoid futures in low volatility/range conditions unless using for hedges or advanced strategies.
- Quick scalps; avoid holding for big moves

## 4. High Volatility

### How to Identify Quickly:
- **Price Action:**  
  - Large, rapid moves in both directions; long candle wicks; gaps.
  - Price whipsaws above/below key levels.
- **Volatility Indicator:**  
  - VIX index or implied volatility spikes above recent averages.
- **Volume:**  
  - Sudden surges, often on news/events.
- **Breadth:**  
  - Extreme dispersion, some stocks up big, others down big.

### Favourable Trades:
- Quick Intraday trades (small targets, tight stops)
- Option Selling (if IV is extremely high and you manage risk)
- **Stock Futures:** Only for experienced traders; use with tight stop losses and reduced position size—volatility can amplify both gains and losses.
- Avoid swing/positional until volatility stabilizes
- Avoid over-leveraging or trading against news

## Stock Futures: Best Practices

- **Liquidity:** Only trade liquid futures (tight spreads, high OI/volume).
- **Leverage:** Use sensible position sizing; leverage amplifies both gains and losses.
- **SL & Risk:** Always use a stop loss; predefine max loss per trade and stick to it.
- **Trend:** Align with prevailing trend for positional/swing; avoid counter-trend futures trades.
- **Expiry Awareness:** Futures have expiry dates; be mindful of rollover and price convergence.
