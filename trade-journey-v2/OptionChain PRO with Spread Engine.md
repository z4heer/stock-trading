# What This Upgrade Adds 📊

## 1️⃣ Automatic Expected Move

Using ATM straddle:

* ATM CE + ATM PE
* Estimates market movement.

This helps avoid trades that require unrealistic moves.

---

# 2️⃣ Spread Width Suggestion

The sheet now suggests:

| Expected Move | Suggested Spread |
| ------------- | ---------------- |
| <150 pts      | 100 spread       |
| 150–250 pts   | 200 spread       |

> 250 pts | 300 spread |

This aligns spreads with volatility.
