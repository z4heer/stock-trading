# ✅ Your Trading Identity (Now Clearly Defined)

* Capital: ₹50,000
* Risk per trade: 3% (~₹1,500)
* Instrument: NIFTY Weekly Options (Lot size 65)
* Style: Directional 5-min breakout trader
* Structure: ITM–ATM Debit Spread (50-point width)

# 📊 Correct Spread Structure (Important Fix)

Instead of:
Buy ATM – Sell +50

Now:
Buy Slight ITM – Sell ATM

Rule:
Net debit ≤ 23 points
(23 × 65 ≈ ₹1,495 max risk)

If debit > 23 → Skip trade.

Non-negotiable.

---

# 🗓 Weekly Execution Model

### 🔥 Tuesday (Expiry Day)

* Fast trades only
* Book at ₹700–₹900
* No holding for full target
* No late entries

### 🟢 Wednesday (Best Day)

* Primary attack day
* Can hold till resistance if structure intact
* Target ₹1,000–₹1,200

### Other Days

* Trade only Grade A setups
* No forcing trades

---

# 🛑 Capital Protection System

If capital hits:

* ₹47k → Trade only Grade A
* ₹45k → Risk reduce to 2%
* ₹42.5k → Stop for 1 week

Even if you feel calm at drawdowns, rules stay mechanical.

---

# 🎯 Exit Rules (Now Locked)

Profit:

* 50–60% of max profit
* OR next level touch
* Tuesday = quick booking
* Wednesday = level-to-level

Loss:

* Full debit lost
* OR structure breaks
* OR no movement within 45–60 min

No averaging.
No revenge trades.
Max 2 trades/day.
