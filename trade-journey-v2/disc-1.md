# Current Situation (9:30 approx)

**Index:** NIFTY 50
Price: **~25735**
Expiry: **Tomorrow (near-expiry → gamma high)**
IVP earlier: **Very high**

Your position:

**Bear Put Debit Spread**

* Buy **25300 PE**
* Sell **25200 PE**

Market is currently **~430 points above your long strike**, so the trade only works if we get a **sharp selloff**.

Right now the market is not showing that yet.

# What We Watch Until 9:50

### 1️⃣ Price Structure

Important levels:

| Level | Meaning           |
| ----- | ----------------- |
| 25800 | breakout zone     |
| 25750 | intraday pivot    |
| 25620 | weakness trigger  |
| 25550 | downside momentum |

---

### 2️⃣ Option Chain Shift

We want to see:

**Bearish confirmation**

• Call OI building at ATM
• Put OI unwinding
• PCR dropping

If that happens, downside probability increases.

---

# Scenarios at 9:50

## Scenario A — Bearish Confirmation

If NIFTY moves below:

**25620**

Then your trade **suddenly becomes alive**.

Because market may move toward:

```
25550
25480
```

In this case:

👉 Hold the spread.

---

# Scenario B — Market Stable / Bullish

If price stays:

**above 25750**

Then:

• put premiums will decay
• recovery probability drops further.

Then best action:

👉 Exit and reset trade.

---

# What New Trade Could Look Like

If IV still high and market range:

Example **Credit Spread**

Bull Put Spread:

Sell **25500 PE**
Buy **25300 PE**

This aligns with:

• strong support
• time decay advantage.

---

# Important Detail

Tomorrow expiry means:

**premium decay will accelerate after 11 AM.**

If your trade is not moving by then, recovery becomes harder.

---

# My Suggestion Right Now

Do exactly what you said:

**Observe till 9:50.**

But watch these specifically:

1. Does **25620 break?**
2. Does **25800 break?**
3. Does option chain shift?

That will determine everything.

---

# Quick Question (helps a lot)

At the moment:

• What is **ATM strike now — 25700 or 25800?**
• What is **ATM straddle price (CE + PE)?**

This tells expected move and improves decision quality.
