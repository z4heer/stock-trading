Perfect — this is the **right moment to review (around 10:15)**. I’ll analyze **price + option chain + your position** together.

We’re looking at **NIFTY 50**.

Current:

* Price ≈ **25731**
* Expiry: **Tomorrow**
* IVP ≈ **91–92**

---

# 1️⃣ Price Action (15-min Chart)

What I see:

**Range structure forming**

Key levels visible on chart:

| Level | Meaning         |
| ----- | --------------- |
| 25800 | Supply zone     |
| 25700 | Intraday pivot  |
| 25620 | Support         |
| 25580 | Breakdown level |

Market currently:

• reclaiming 25700
• holding above support.

So structure = **neutral → slightly bullish**.

No sign of panic selling.

---

# 2️⃣ Option Chain Shift (Very Important)

Big change from earlier screenshot.

### Put Side

Massive additions:

| Strike | Put OI Change |
| ------ | ------------- |
| 25700  | +448%         |
| 25750  | +837%         |
| 25800  | +162%         |

This means traders **selling puts aggressively**.

Interpretation:

👉 Market expecting **support above 25700**.

---

### Call Side

Call writers active:

| Strike | Call OI |
| ------ | ------- |
| 25800  |         |
| 25850  |         |
| 25900  |         |

This builds **ceiling**.

---

# 3️⃣ Market Expectation Now

Range tightening:

```
25700 — 25850
```

This is classic **expiry range building**.

---

# 4️⃣ What This Means For Your Trade

Your strikes:

• 25300 PE
• 25200 PE

Market is **400 points away** and building support higher.

Probability of reaching your strike **keeps decreasing**.

Your spread value likely continues decaying.

---

# 5️⃣ Most Important Signal Today

Put writing at **25700 and 25750**.

This is **bullish support creation**.

Unless these unwind, downside unlikely.

---

# 6️⃣ If Breakdown Happens

Only if this breaks:

```
25620
```

Then market could go:

```
25550
```

But still far from 25300.

---

# 7️⃣ Professional Decision Point

Given:

• expiry tomorrow
• IV high earlier
• range forming
• your strike far away.

Holding becomes **low probability recovery**.

---

# 8️⃣ My Honest Advice

If I were managing this trade:

I would **close the position now** and reset.

Because:

* theta acceleration today
* support above market
* probability very low.

Capital protection matters.

---

# 9️⃣ What New Trade Looks Better

Since option sellers dominating.

Example idea:

### Bull Put Spread

Sell **25600 PE**
Buy **25400 PE**

Why:

• support near 25700
• range market
• time decay works.

---

# 🔟 Important Learning From This Trade

You entered **bearish debit spread** when:

• IV high
• no breakdown
• support nearby.

Better entry would be after **support breaks**.

That’s a key improvement for future.

---

# Quick Question Before Final Decision

What is current value of your spread now?

```
25300 PE
25200 PE
```

If you send that, we can calculate:

• exact exit loss
• risk vs waiting till afternoon.

###
# Current Situation (9:30 approx)

**Index:** NIFTY 50
Price: **~25735**
Expiry: **Tomorrow (near-expiry → gamma high)**
IVP earlier: **Very high**

Your position:

**Bear Put Debit Spread**

* Buy **25300 PE**
* Sell **25200 PE**

Market is currently **~430 points above your long strike**, so the trade only works if we get a **sharp selloff**.

Right now the market is not showing that yet.

---

# What We Watch Until 9:50

### 1️⃣ Price Structure

Important levels:

| Level | Meaning           |
| ----- | ----------------- |
| 25800 | breakout zone     |
| 25750 | intraday pivot    |
| 25620 | weakness trigger  |
| 25550 | downside momentum |

---

### 2️⃣ Option Chain Shift

We want to see:

**Bearish confirmation**

• Call OI building at ATM
• Put OI unwinding
• PCR dropping

If that happens, downside probability increases.

---

# Scenarios at 9:50

## Scenario A — Bearish Confirmation

If NIFTY moves below:

**25620**

Then your trade **suddenly becomes alive**.

Because market may move toward:

```
25550
25480
```

In this case:

👉 Hold the spread.

---

# Scenario B — Market Stable / Bullish

If price stays:

**above 25750**

Then:

• put premiums will decay
• recovery probability drops further.

Then best action:

👉 Exit and reset trade.

---

# What New Trade Could Look Like

If IV still high and market range:

Example **Credit Spread**

Bull Put Spread:

Sell **25500 PE**
Buy **25300 PE**

This aligns with:

• strong support
• time decay advantage.

---

# Important Detail

Tomorrow expiry means:

**premium decay will accelerate after 11 AM.**

If your trade is not moving by then, recovery becomes harder.

---

# My Suggestion Right Now

Do exactly what you said:

**Observe till 9:50.**

But watch these specifically:

1. Does **25620 break?**
2. Does **25800 break?**
3. Does option chain shift?

That will determine everything.

---

# Quick Question (helps a lot)

At the moment:

• What is **ATM strike now — 25700 or 25800?**
• What is **ATM straddle price (CE + PE)?**

This tells expected move and improves decision quality.
