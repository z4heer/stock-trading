Great — let’s estimate the **probability of a further downside move** using the option prices you just gave.

We’re analyzing **NIFTY 50** at **12:05 PM**.

Current inputs:

| Item     | Value     |
| -------- | --------- |
| Spot     | **25664** |
| 25700 CE | **78**    |
| 25700 PE | **113**   |

---

# 1️⃣ Market’s Expected Move (From Options)

ATM Straddle:

```text
78 + 113 = 191
```

This means the options market expects roughly:

```
±191 points
```

Range implied:

```
Upper: 25664 + 191 ≈ 25855
Lower: 25664 - 191 ≈ 25473
```

So **25550 is inside the expected range**.

That’s important.

---

# 2️⃣ Probability Approximation

In options pricing:

| Distance from price    | Rough probability |
| ---------------------- | ----------------- |
| Within 1 expected move | ~65–70%           |
| Beyond 1 expected move | lower probability |

Since **25550 is inside**, probability is **not small**.

But we must adjust for **time left today**.

---

# 3️⃣ Time-of-Day Adjustment

It’s already around **midday**.

Most large moves usually happen:

| Time      | Behaviour      |
| --------- | -------------- |
| Morning   | volatility     |
| Midday    | compression    |
| Afternoon | secondary move |

So the probability decreases slightly.

---

# 4️⃣ Realistic Probability

For **today only**:

Chance of touching **25550** roughly:

```
~35–40%
```

Chance of staying above **25600**:

```
~60–65%
```

This aligns with the current structure.

---

# 5️⃣ What Options Market Is Signaling

Notice:

```
25700 PE = 113
25700 CE = 78
```

Put is heavier, meaning **downside hedging exists**, but not panic.

If traders expected a crash:

PE would be exploding much faster.

---

# 6️⃣ Important Level Now

The real trigger remains:

```
25640
```

If this breaks decisively:

Probability of **25550 increases sharply**.

If it holds:

Market likely drifts sideways.

---

# 7️⃣ Impact on Your Spread

Current spread:

```
25300 – 25200
```

Even if market reaches **25550**, the spread might go roughly:

```
5 → 10–15
```

Still below breakeven but improved.

A move toward **25450–25400** would be needed for strong recovery.

---

# 8️⃣ Decision Logic From Probability

Given:

* ~60% chance of range
* ~40% chance of deeper drop
* very small remaining risk

Holding a bit longer is **not unreasonable**, but expectations should be realistic.

---

# 9️⃣ Practical Trader Mindset

At this point the trade has effectively become:

```
small-risk optionality
```

Meaning:

• limited downside left
• payoff only if market accelerates.

That’s fine as long as you’re aware.

---

# 10️⃣ What I Would Watch Next

Three things:

1️⃣ Break of **25640**
2️⃣ ATM straddle expanding again
3️⃣ Put OI unwinding.

If these occur together → downside continuation.

---

# Overall Situation

You are currently positioned in a **lottery-style trade with some downside momentum still possible**.

But the market is not yet confirming a strong trend.

That is where many of these spreads suddenly change value.
