## 1. Market Trend Assessment

**Purpose:**  
Gauge overall market direction (bullish, bearish, sideways) to align your trades with the broader trend.

### Checklist:
- **Index Direction:**  
  - Check Nifty, BankNifty, S&P500, etc. (Are they trending up, down, or consolidating?)
  - Is the index near support/resistance or breaking out/breaking down?
- **Breadth:**  
  - Advance/Decline ratio? Are most stocks participating in the move?
  - Major sector indices in agreement with main index?
- **Momentum:**  
  - RSI above 60 = strong bullish; below 40 = bearish.
  - MACD above zero line = bullish bias.
- **Volatility:**  
  - India VIX or similar index: High = possible swings; Low = trending/steady moves.

## 2. Sector Strength

**Purpose:**  
Identify outperforming or underperforming sectors to choose the best stocks or avoid weak areas.

### Checklist:
- **Sector Performance (last 1-5 days):**  
  - Top 2-3 sectors leading the market?
  - Any sectors showing reversal or fresh breakout?
- **Relative Strength:**  
  - Is your stock’s sector outperforming the index?
  - Avoid sectors lagging the market unless trading reversals.

## 3. Stock Trend & Technical Condition

**Purpose:**  
Choose stocks in line with both market and sector trends for higher-probability trades.

### Checklist:

  - Is the stock above key moving averages (20/50/200 EMA)?
  - Recent price action: breakout, pullback, reversal, or range?
- **Volume:**  
  - Is today’s volume higher than average?  
  - Volume spike on breakout/breakdown?
- **Indicators:**  
  - RSI: Overbought (>70), Oversold (<30), or in trend zone (40–60)?
